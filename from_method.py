# From Keyword
# The from keyword is used to import a module
from math import sqrt,ceil

x = sqrt(9)
print(x)

y = ceil(x)
print(y)

# We were able to use sqrt() and ciel 
# without typing the import math module
# When we use the from keyword we can use
# the method name directly without referencing
# the module
