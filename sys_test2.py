# Tip Calculator
# Create a program that lets the user input their total bill
# at a restaurant, and returns the total cost of the bill
# including a tip. Use 15% of the total bill as the
# tip calculation.

# For example, if the total bill is KSh 1000, 
# the tip is 0.15 * 1000 = KSh 150, so the total cost
# of the bill returned to the user is 1000 + 150 = KSh 1150.

# Once you're finished, take this a step further 
# and let the user enter their level of satisfaction
# with their service and factor that value into the 
# tip percentage. For example, if they received good service, the tip is 15%; great service is 20%; terrible service is 0%.
