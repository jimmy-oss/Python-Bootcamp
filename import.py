# Modules and Packages in python3
# Modules are files containing Python definitions and statements.
# A module can define functions, classes, and variables
# Package is made up of one or more modules that are
# joined to perform a particular task

# Math Module
import math
b = math.sqrt(9)
print(b)

y = math.ceil(b)
print(y)

# In python3 there are many import out there but
# the most popular one is called the math module
# which is used to perform mathematical operations
# on numbers
# The sqrt() method is used to find the square root of 9 
# which is 3.0 is represented on our variable b
# The ceil() method is used to find the nearest integer
# the method rounds up our b = (3) into 3.0
# The Syntax that is used in module methods
# module_name is the name of the module in our case our module
# is import math then there is
# .method_name is the name of the method which in our case
# we have used .sqrt() and .ciel()
